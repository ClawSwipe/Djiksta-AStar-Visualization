# Djiksta AStar Visualization using HTML, CSS and Javascript
Run indexfinal.html. Simply click anywhere on the grid to add points. You can then right-click on any two points to connect them with an edge. Once you've created your graph, choose a starting and ending node by clicking on them. Next, select either Dijkstra's algorithm or A* algorithm from the dropdown menu. Finally, click the 'Find Path' button to visualize the shortest path between the selected nodes. Happy pathfinding!"
